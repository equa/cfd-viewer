"""Trame front end: a browser UI over the OpenFOAM VTK pipeline.

Rendering runs in either of two modes, switchable at runtime:

``local``
    Geometry is serialised to the browser and drawn by vtk.js on the client's
    GPU. Camera interaction costs no round trips, which is what you want over a
    slow link -- at the price of shipping the geometry.
``remote``
    The server renders with OSMesa and streams JPEG frames. The client needs no
    GPU and the geometry never leaves the server, which matters for big cases.

Because the colour scalars are baked into a real array by the pipeline (see
:mod:`foamviz.pipeline`), both modes show the same picture.
